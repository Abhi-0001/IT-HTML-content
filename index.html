        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold
            for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of
            the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows,
            hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of
            academic goose-flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and
            bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to
            wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands
            gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen,
            dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did
            it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the
            polished tubes like butter, streak after luscious streak in long
            recession down the work tables. "And this," said the Director
            opening the door, "is the Fertilizing Room." Bent over their
            instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as the Director
            of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely
            breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle,
            of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very
            young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the
            Director's heels. Each of them carried a notebook, in which,
            whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight
            from the horse's mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D. H. C. for
            Central London always made a point of personally conducting his new
            students round the various departments. "Just to give you a general
            idea," he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general
            idea they must have, if they were to do their work
            intelligentlyâ€“though as little of one, if they were to be good and
            happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one
            knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are
            intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers but fret-sawyers
            and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.

          "Eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index," said Mr. Foster with
          relish, as they entered. "Containing all the relevant information,"
          added the Director. "Brought up to date every morning." "And
          co-ordinated every afternoon." "On the basis of which they make their
          calculations." "So many individuals, of such and such quality," said
          Mr. Foster. "Distributed in such and such quantities." "The optimum
          Decanting Rate at any given moment." "Unforeseen wastages promptly
          made good." "Promptly," repeated Mr. Foster. "If you knew the amount
          of overtime I had to put in after the last Japanese earthquake!" He
          laughed goodhumouredly and shook his head. "The Predestinators send in
          their figures to the Fertilizers." "Who give them the embryos they ask
          for." "And the bottles come in here to be predestined in detail."
          "After which they are sent down to the Embryo Store." "Where we now
          proceed ourselves."
